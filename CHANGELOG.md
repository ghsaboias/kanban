### Technical Implementation
- **API Structure**: Organized routes in separate files (boards.ts, columns.ts, cards.ts, users.ts)

- **Type Safety**: Request/response type definitions in `types/api.ts`
- **Database Integration**: Proper use of Prisma relationships and queries
- **Testing**: All endpoints manually tested and verified working

### Fixed
- **String ID Handling**: Updated all routes to properly handle CUID string IDs instead of integers
